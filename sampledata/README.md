## Sample Chat Data
Due to the length and possible punctuation (commas, quotes etc) the sample data is created with delimited "|" and escaped quotes. 

The data loader in APEX has been configured to import this data format:

operator_id | chat_content

      1 | "Hello, I am sample data, and I am calling about \"late fees\". Please can someone help me?"
      2 | "Hello, I am more sample data, and I am calling about my income tax."


## Data Export
Here is an example of exporting data (from Oracle Autonomous Database) in the format above (into an Object Store Bucket).

      BEGIN
      DBMS_CLOUD.EXPORT_DATA(
        credential_name =>'<CREDENTIAL>',
        file_uri_list =>'https://<namespace>.objectstorage.ap-sydney-1.oci.customer-oci.com/n/<namespace>/b/<bucket_name>/o/sampledata/callcentre.csv',
        format => JSON_OBJECT('type' value 'csv', 'quote' value '"', 'escape' value true, 'delimiter' value '|', 'header' value true),
        query => 'SELECT OPERATOR_ID, CHAT_CONTENT FROM CALLCENTRE'
      );
      END;


Note: The Sampe CSV included above is 100% generated by OCI Gen AI service and any similarity to real situations or names is purely coincidental!
